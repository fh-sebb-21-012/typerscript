    <h2>tl;dr</h2>
    <p>TyperScript is a typing test application, created for the Web Development course at FH Hagenberg,
      Upper Austria, made to demonstrate the TypeScript programming language.</p>
    <p>With TyperScript, you can measure your typing speed and save your highscores to the leaderboard.</p>

    <div class="box box-info flex flex-center">Aside from being programmed in TypeScript, TyperScript is in no way
      affiliated with the
      TypeScript project itself!

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <h3>Introducing TypeScript</h3>
    <h4>Why restrictions are actually good for you</h4>
    <p>
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
      standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
      make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
      typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
      sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
      PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
