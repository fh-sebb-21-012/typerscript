  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Introducing TypeScript</h3>
    <p>
      TypeScript is a programming language and a superset of JavaScript. It extends JavaScript with many new features,
      first and foremost "static typing", making it a perfect fit for large-scale projects.
    </p>

    <h4>Strongly-typed programming languages</h4>
    <p>
      Programming languages like TypeScript are called "strongly typed" because variable types (e.g.
      number, string, boolean) must be explicitly defined. The compiler will check that the variable is used
      consistently
      with that type.
    </p>

    <h4>Why restrictions are actually good for you</h4>
    <p>
      Whilst restrictive by nature, TypeScripts type system can help catch errors early in the development process,
      improving the quality and maintainability of your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some important advantages of using TypeScript over JavaScript:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5>Catching errors early</h5>
        <p>
          With TypeScripts type system, the compiler can check that variables are used consistently
          with their declared types. For example, if a variable is declared as a number and a string is assigned to it,
          the compiler will
          give an error. This can help catch errors early in the development process, before they make it to
          production, saving time and resources in the long run.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>Improved code readability</h5>
        <p>
          TypeScripts type system can also serve to improve the readability of the code. By explicitly defining the
          types of variables, functions, and interfaces, the structure and expected behavior of the code can be
          understood more easily. This can make it easier for new developers to understand and work on the project.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>Enforce consistency</h5>
        <p>
          TypeScripts type system can help enforce consistency in the codebase by ensuring that variables are used
          consistently with their declared types. This improves maintainability and reduce the likelihood of bugs.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>Better refactoring</h5>
        <p>
          TypeScripts type system can also make it easier to refactor code. With explicit type
          information, the compiler is able to validate, that changes to the codebase don't break existing
          functionality. This can
          save
          time and resources when making changes to the codebase.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>Type narrowing</h5>
        <p>
          TypeScript allows you to perform type narrowing, meaning that the type of a variable can
          be narrowed down based on its value, allowing for more accurate type checking and helping
          developers understand the projects code. This can help to catch errors early and improve the overall code
          quality.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>Interfaces and custom types</h5>
        <p>
          TypeScript allows developers to define interfaces, which are used to describe an objects structure. Developers
          can make sure that objects used in their application contain specific properties. TypeScript also features
          custom types, restricting the values a variable can possibly hold. This can help in organizing and structuring
          the codebase, resulting in more readable and maintainable code.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In summary, the coding restrictions TypeScript imposes on developers can greatly enhance the codebase by
      providing better type checking, improving code readability and enforcing code consistency. This reduces the amount
      of bugs, improves developer productivity, and makes it easier to maintain and scale the project.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h3>Using TypeScript</h3>
    <h4>Introducing interfaces and custom types</h4>
    <p>
      TypeScript allows you to define interfaces, describing the structure and properties of variables. You can also
      define custom types, allowing a variable to only hold data of the types you specified.
    </p>

    <h5>Using interfaces and custom types on variables</h5>
    <div class="code-section">
      <pre>
interface Point {
    x: number;
    y: number;
}

let point: Point = { x: 3, y: 4 };
console.log(point); // { x: 3, y: 4 }</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      In the example above, an interface is used to define the properties of an object representing a 2D point. It has
      two numeric properties: "x" and "y".
    </p>
    <p>
      When we create a variable called "point", adhering to the "Point" interface, the type
      checker will ensure that all required properties defined in the interface are specified and that the values are of
      the
      correct type.
    </p>

    <h5>Using interfaces and custom types with functions</h5>
    <p>
      Interfaces can also be used to define function arguments and return values. For example:
    </p>
    <div class="code-section">
      <pre>
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}

function getFullName(person: Person): string {
    return `${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}`;
}

const user: Person = { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' };
console.log(getFullName(user)); // John Doe</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      Here, the interface called "Person" has two properties "firstName" and "lastName", both of type
      string. The parameter passed to the function <code>getFullName()</code> needs to be of type <code>Person</code>,
      resulting the function to return the Persons full name as a string.
    </p>

    <h4>Type narrowing</h4>
    <p>
      Type narrowing in TypeScript allow developers to determine the type of a variable based on its value during
      runtime, allowing for
      more accurate type checking, especially if the data comes from outside sources (e.g. API calls, ...).
    </p>
    <!--    <h5>Primitive types</h5>-->
    <!--    <p></p>-->
    <!--    <div class="code-section">-->
    <!--      <pre>-->
    <!--let value = 'hello';-->

    <!--if (typeof value === 'string') {-->
    <!--    value.toUpperCase(); // type is narrowed to string-->
    <!--}</pre>-->
    <!--    </div>-->
    <!--    <p>-->
    <!--      In the above example, we are checking the type of the "value" variable. If the type-->
    <!--      is a string, we can then safely access the string-only <code>toUpperCase()</code> method on the variable.-->
    <!--    </p>-->

    <h4>Commonly used operators for type narrowing</h4>
    <p>
      TypeScript provides several operators for type narrowing, each of which allowing you to determine the type of a
      variable at runtime:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5>typeof</h5>
        <p>
          For checking if a variable holds a primitive value, you can use the <code>typeof</code> operator. It returns a
          string that represents the type of the variable and can be used like in the following example:
        </p>
        <div class="code-section">
          <pre>
let value = 'hello';

if (typeof value === 'string') {
  // toUpperCase() can only be used on strings
  value.toUpperCase();
}</pre>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>instanceof</h5>
        <p>
          This operator can be used to check if a variable is an instance of the given
          class and returns "true" if it is. For example:
        </p>
        <div class="code-section">
          <pre>class Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

let value = new Point();

if (value instanceof Point) {
  // type is narrowed to 'Point', we can now safely access 'x'
  value.x = 3;
}</pre>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>in</h5>
        <p>
          This operator can be used to check if a property or key is present in an object and returns "true" if it is.
          For example:
        </p>
        <div class="code-section">
          <pre>
let value = { x: 3, y: 4 };

if ('x' in value && typeof value.x === "number") {
  // 'value' has a property called 'x', holding a number, which we can now safely access
  value.x = 4;
}</pre>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>User-defined type guards</h4>
    <p>
      Value types can also be narrowed down using user-defined type guard functions:
    </p>
    <div class="code-section">
          <pre>
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  address?: string;
}

function hasAddress(person: Person): person is Person & { address: string } {
  return 'address' in person;
}

let person: Person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };

if (hasAddress(person)) {
  console.log(person.address);
}</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      In this example, the interface "Person" has three properties: "name", "age" and optionally "address". The function
      <code>hasAddress()</code> returns a type predicate indicating whether the "address" property is present in the
      given value.
    </p>
    <div class="box box-info">
      <strong>Hint:</strong>
      <span class="flex flex-col flex-center">
        The TypeScript compiler will recognize type narrowing and treat variables passed to them accordingly in the respective branches of the if-condition.
      </span>
    </div>

      <span class="heading-main">Code comparison</span>
      <span class="heading-sub">Making code safer and easier to read by using TS instead of JS</span>
    </h3>

    <div class="code-section"><pre>
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
console.log(add(1, 2));</pre>
    </div>
    <div class="code-section">
       <pre>
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}
console.log(add(1, 2));</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      The main difference between the two examples is that in TypeScript, the types of the parameters and the return
      value are explicitly defined, whereas in JavaScript, they are not. This can help catch errors early in the
      development process.
    </p>

    <div class="code-section">
       <pre>
const obj = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
obj.age = 'thirty';  // this will not give any error</pre>
    </div>
    <div class="code-section">
       <pre>
const obj: { name: string, age: number } = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
obj.age = 'thirty';  // this will give an error</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      In TypeScript, we define the type of the variable "obj", and the compiler will check that it is used consistently
      with that type, this will prevent unexpected type changes and give error if it occurs, while in JavaScript this is
      not the case.
    </p>

    <h3>Summary and key takeaways</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h4>Pros and Cons of using TypeScript</h4>
    <p>
      TypeScripts type system and other features can help improve developer productivity and make it easier to
      maintain and scale code. However, it can also add complexity to the development process and may require a steeper
      learning curve for developers who are not familiar with strongly-typed languages.
    </p>

    <h5>Pros</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5>Zero runtime performance overhead</h5>
        <p>
          Because TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript before execution, using it introduces no additional performance
          overhead to your application.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Strongly-typed language</h5>
        <p>
          TypeScripts type system can help catch errors early in the development process by
          ensuring that variables are used consistently with their declared types. This can help prevent bugs and makes
          the projects code more maintainable in the long run.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Improved code readability</h5>
        <p>
          TypeScripts type system also helps developers read existing code. By explicitly defining the types of
          variables, functions, and interfaces, it becomes easier to understand the structure and expected behavior of
          the code.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Enforced consistency</h5>
        <p>
          TypeScripts type system can help enforce consistency in the codebase by ensuring that
          variables are used consistently with their declared types. This consistency enables easier maintainability
          over time and severely reduces the likelihood of bugs in the code.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Better refactoring</h5>
        <p>
          TypeScripts type system can also make it easier to refactor code. With explicit type
          information, the compiler can check that changes to the codebase don't break existing functionality.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Interfaces and custom types</h5>
        <p>
          TypeScript allows for defining interfaces, enabling developers to check whether variables in the code have a certain structure and contain specific properties before accessing them.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Cons</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5>Additional setup and configuration</h5>
        <p>
          To use TypeScript, developers need to set up the compiler and
          configure the project, adding complexity to the development process.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>Additional learning curve</h5>
        <p>
          Developers need to learn the additional features and syntax of TypeScript, which can
          add some overhead to the development process.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>Additional build step</h5>
        <p>
          TypeScript code needs to be transpiled to JavaScript before it can run in a browser or
          JavaScript runtime. This adds an additional build step to the development process, slowing down the debug
          workflow.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      All in all, using TypeScript over JavaScript in your project can bring benefits like improved code quality and
      better code maintainability. In contrast, TypeScript also requires some additional setup, has a steeper learning
      curve than basic JavaScript, and also introduces small a overhead during development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Choosing either TypeScript or JavaScript should be based on the specific needs of the project and the development
      team.
